SYNTAX PARSERS
##############

- A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.
- You are not actually giving your computer the code, you are giving it a translation of it.
- EG:

    YOUR CODE --> COMPILER (syntax parsing) --> MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS

EXECUTION CONTEXTS
##################

- A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
- There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.

####


LEXICAL ENVIRONMENTS
####################

- Where something PHYSICALLY SITS in the code you write.
- A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which WHERE you write something is IMPORTANT.
- So when we talk about lexical environment, we are talking about WHERE IT IS WRITTEN AND WHAT SURROUNDS IT.
