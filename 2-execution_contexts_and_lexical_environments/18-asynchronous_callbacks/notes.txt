ASYNCHRONOUS
############

- More than one at a time.

####


- The browser has many types of engines or softwares working inside of it for example
  - THE JS ENGINE itself.
  - THE RENDERING ENGINE which defines what the page looks like.
  - HTTP REQUESTS

- The JS engine has links to these various engines. It is when the JS engine requests some form of functionality from the engines is when you have asynchronous actions happen.

- BUT REMEMBER THE CODE THAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF THE JS ENGINE IS IN FACT SYNCHRONOUS.

- So inside the JS Engine, you actually have your Global Execution Context at the bottom of the EXECUTION STACK, and next to it is the EVENT QUEUE.

EVENT QUEUE
###########

- When you create a click events or make an Http request, the JS engine will actually look at your EVENT QUEUE ONLY WHEN THE EXECUTION STACK IS EMPTY.

- THE BROWSER IS ASYNCHRONOUSLY PUTTING THINGS INTO THE EVENT QUEUE, BUT JS STILL EXECUTES ITS CODE SYNCHRONOUSLY.
