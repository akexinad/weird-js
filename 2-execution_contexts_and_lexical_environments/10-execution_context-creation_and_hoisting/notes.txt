- The function gets HOISTED up to the top but not var a.

- This is because the EXECUTION CONTEXT is created in TWO PHASES:

PHASE 1
THE CREATION PHASE
##################

- the GLOBAL OBJECT, 'this' and the OUTER ENVIRONMENT is created and stored in memory.
- IN ADDITION, it sets up Memory Space for Variables and Functions. THIS STEP (for some reason) IS CALLED HOISTING.

- So in this phase, your code is ALREADY STORED IN MEMORY BEFORE IT EVEN BEGINS THE NEXT PHASE.
- So when the engine goes back to grab the variable and the function, the variable is given an initial value/placeholder of undefined in memory, and the function is stored in its entirety.
- This is one of the reasons why it is bad to rely on hoisting.

PHASE 2
THE EXECUTION PHASE
###################

- VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS HAPPEN IN THE EXECUTION PHASE. This is the reason why your variable is initially undefined when executed.
