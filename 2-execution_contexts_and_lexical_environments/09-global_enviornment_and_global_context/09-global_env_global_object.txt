- So when code is run, it runs inside an execution context. That is, THE WRAPPER that wraps and runs your code.

- THE BASE EXECUTION CONTEXT IS YOUR GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT.

- The GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT creates 2 things for you:
  - 1) A GLOBAL OBJECT (A Collection of name/value pairs).
  - 2) And a special variable called 'this'.

- These two things are created for by the JAVASCRIPT ENGINE. In the case of the browser that is the V8 engine.

- There will always be a global object, in the case of the browser, when you log 'this', it is the WINDOW.

- Another thing you get within the EXECUTION CONTEXT is a link to the OUTER ENVIRONMENT.
