- Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.
- Assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on the fly.

- This function is a SPECIAL TYPE OF OBJECT.
- Like an object, you can attach to it:
  - Primitives (name value pairs).
  - Other objects.
  - Other functions.

- A function can be anonymous, it doesn't have to have a name.
- A function has a separate CODE property and is INVOCABLE.
