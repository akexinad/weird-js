- JSON = JS Object Notation.
- JSON is inspired by the object literal notation.

Before JSON, information was passed around in the form of XML:

<object>
  <firstname>Mary</firstname>
  <isAProgrammer>true</isAProgrammer>
</object>


- ANYTHING JSON VALID IS OBJECT LITERAL VALID, BUT NOT VICE VERSA.
