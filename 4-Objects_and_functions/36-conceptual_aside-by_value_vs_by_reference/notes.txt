- Means that when you declare a PRIMITIVE VARIABLE 'a' which is then stored in memory, and then you declare b = a, b will be a new copy of a with its own spot IN MEMORY.

####

BY REFERENCE
############

- Means that when you declare an OBJECT 'a', and then you declare b = a, IT IS THE SAME OBJECT IN MEMORY.

####

NOTE: All Primitive types are by VALUE and all objects are by REFERENCE.
