- Remember that when you invoke a function and create a new execution context, you get 'this'.
- When you use the 'new' operator, it changes what 'this' points to. It points to the new empty object that the 'new' operator creates.

FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR
####################

- A normal function that is used to construct objects.
- The 'this' variable points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.
