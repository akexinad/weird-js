INHERITANCE
###########

- One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

####


CLASSICAL INHERITANCE
#####################

- Pretty much means what is currently best known and popular.
- It exists in C#, Java and this is the way they share properties and methods.
- It is not bad, but it can get very verbose.

####


PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE
######################

- Much simpler compared to classical inheritance.
- Flexible
- Extensible
- Easy to understand
