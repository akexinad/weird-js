- All objects have a prototype property.

- When obj looks for prop2 and does not find it, it goes down into its proto {} and looks for prop2 there. If it finds it, it returns.

- So prop2 may seem its on the obj property when in reality its on its proto {}.

- THE JS ENGINE DOES THE WORK OF LOOKING DOWN WHATS IS CALLED THE PROTOTYPE CHAIN. Similar to the scope chain in function, but different in nature.

- Objects can share all the same prototypes.
    - So when you create an obj2 and search for prop2, both obj.prop2 and obj2.prop2 are actually pointing as the same spot in memory.


- BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN JS IS AN OBJECT!
